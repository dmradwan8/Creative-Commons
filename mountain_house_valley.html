        <h1>Sharing Creative Works with the World</h1>
        <p>Creative Commons gives everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work. Creative Commons licenses helps creators share their works and create new works based on the works of others.</p> 
        <p>To choose a license, answer these questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do I want to allow people to copy, distribute, display, or perform my work (“use”)?</li>
            <li>Do I want to allow modifications to be made of my work (“remix”)?</li>
            <li>What kind of license do I want? A license that is all-in-one, or a suite of separate licenses?</li>
            <li>Do I want to impose any conditions on people who use my work?</li>
        </ul>
