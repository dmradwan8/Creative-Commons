    <h2>What is Creative Commons?</h2>
    <p>Creative Commons (CC) is an organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share. The organization has released several copyright-licenses known as Creative Commons licenses free of charge to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators.</p>
    <h2>What are Creative Commons Licenses?</h2>
    <p>Creative Commons licenses are standard licenses that allow content creators to grant some of their copyright rights to the public while reserving other rights. These licenses allow people to use, remix, or build upon a work – as long as they follow the license guidelines.</p>
    <h2>Types of Creative Commons Licenses</h2>
    <p>There are six types of Creative Commons licenses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Attribution (CC BY) </strong>– This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon a work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creation.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) </strong>- This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit the original creation and license their new creations under the identical terms. This is the most common license used on the Creative Commons.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND) </strong>- This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to the creator.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) </strong>- This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge the original creator and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) </strong>- This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon a work non-commercially, as long as they credit the original creator and license their new creations under the identical terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND) </strong>- This license is the most restrictive of the six main licenses, only allowing others to download a work and share it with others as long as they credit the creator, but they can’t change the work in any way or use it commercially.</li>
    </ul>
